#### This is a basic calculator replica of xiaomi phone's calculator.
It can perform all the basic math operations such as **+** , **-** , __*__ , **/** and **modulo**.  
It stores history of the basic operations too.  
Alog with that it includes operation's like calulating **Age**, **Discount**, **Length**, **Percentage**, **Time**, **Numeral System etc.**

It also contains **Finance Section** in which you can perform calculation like **Currency conversion** which supports 30 different currencies and the currency rate is fetched from api.
Along with that it also contains **Bill split** and **GST calculation** features.

### I also tried to make this as PWA.
